        <h4>A data visualization of leading causes of death in the 20th century.</h4><br>
        <p>The visualization clearly indicates non communicable and infectious diseases to have claimed more lives in the 20th century, than any another.</p>
        <p>- Hover over each circle for more detail.<br>
- Circle size/radius indicates the number of deaths in comparison to others. Therefore bigger circles are large death counts and smaller circles are lower death counts.</p>
